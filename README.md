I came across this image when I was searching about the history of Convolutional Neural Networks. I started reading the papers of these models in the chronological order.

When I was reading, I realized that the papers were really the building blocks of current day's Computer Vision. One more point to note is that the models which were implemented originally were such a pain as there were no frameworks or any sort of it. Everything was coded from scratch.

But with the help of modern frameworks its just a matter of couple of minutes to implement the architectures. So thats my motivation here. Reading and implementing landmark architectures is really a good way of understanding the trends in the field.

## How are these implemented?

-   Python Notebooks
-   Tensorflow
-   Replicating the architectures as mentioned in the original paper
-   No improvements to the architectures are done
-   If the model is heavy and the weights to the model is available freely then they are used. If not, only the architecture is implemented
-   Data Generators are implemented to match the input dimensions as mentioned on the original paper
-   Additional Pre-Processing techniques like color-correction, noise reduction are not implemented
